# GroundSamReg
## Introduction
This paper proposes a novel registration method that leverages object-based region correspondences (ROIs) to achieve image registration. The proposed approach is training-free, utilizing pre-trained models such as GroundingDINO and SAM to generate corresponding ROIs, enabling a text-ROI-image workflow for registration.
